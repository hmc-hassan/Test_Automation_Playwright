Hi,

Due to some reasons the website is not loading in Pakistan so i had to install Vpn to access the website.
I have automated the cases with respect to the website design where there is an option available to change the language and that
is pre-req to my automation suite. I noticed that with different locations the website design/options adjust itself according 
to the regions.

By the time i wrote these scripts, my location through VPN is United States.


Command to execute tests: npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed
